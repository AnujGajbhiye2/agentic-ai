**Key Takeaways**

*   LingGuang, Ant Group's vibe coding app, achieved over 2 million downloads in 6 days, surpassing ChatGPT & Sora.
*   The app's flash program tool crashed due to excessive usage but has been restored.
*   LingGuang directly generates apps from user prompts using AI, unlike traditional code generators.
*   Ant Group views LingGuang as a key element in its global AI strategy, potentially disrupting the no-code/low-code development landscape.

LingGuang, Ant Group's vibe coding app, exploded onto the scene. Two million downloads in six days! That's faster than ChatGPT and Sora. But all that hype? It crashed the flash program tool last Thursday. Too much love, too soon. Thankfully, it's back up now.

## Vibe Coding: App Creation, Simplified

So, what's the buzz? LingGuang crafts apps directly from your prompts. No code needed. Tweak it with the AI—six edits on average, and *voila*! 3D models, charts, animations... It even packs an "AGI camera" for real-time edits. Find it globally on major app stores.

## Ant Group Bets on AI

This isn't just a random app. It spotlights Ant Group's AI push. They launched the AQ healthcare app in June. Plus, there's the "AGI Lab," cooking up new AI models. He Zhengyu, Ant Group's CTO, says LingGuang wants to give everyone their own AI developer. Bold claim, right?

Early success has Ant Group eyeing the global AI race. Can LingGuang really shake up the no-code/low-code world? Maybe. Its impact is undeniable, and the potential disruption to traditional software development is there. Can it last? That's the million-dollar question.
